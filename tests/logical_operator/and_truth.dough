// skip: both sides of an 'and' need to evaluate to bool. So we need functions to test this! 
// False and null are false.
print(false and "bad"); // expect: false
print(null and "bad"); // expect: null

// Everything else is true.
print(true and "ok"); // expect: ok
print(0 and "ok"); // expect: ok
print("" and "ok"); // expect: ok
